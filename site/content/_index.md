    General Rules:

    * First rule: Be creative and have fun!

    Everybody is invited to take part in our compos, no matter if you are a
    beginner or a scene veteran.

    Your contribution must not have been released before.

    Contributions must be handed in before the respective compo deadline.

    In case of too few compo entries for one compo (less than three) the party
    organizers can cancel or combine competitions.

    By taking part in a competition you agree that we spread your entry (e.g.
    through scene.org) and that we’re allowed to use it in non-commercial
    promotions for upcoming editions of Deadline demoparty.

    Entries containing content which violates German law or are unsuitable will
    be disqualified.

    If your entry contains commercial material it will be disqualified as well.

    The composer of any music released or used in any competition must not be
    registered at any copyright society. This includes – but is not limited to –
    all members of BIEM (take a look at their website for more information).
    Notably GEMA is a member of BIEM.

    If you have questions about these rules, contact the organizers at
    contact@demoparty.berlin
